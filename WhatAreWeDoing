IDENTIFICATION AND SCOPING:

1. How and when was the network breached? Which system is "Patient Zero"?

2. How did the initial infection occur giving the attackers a foothold? What type of exploit was used?

3. When and how did the attackers first laterally move to each system?

4. What were the attacker's primary and secondary command and control backdoors?

CONTAINMENT AND THREAT INTELLIGENCE GATHERING:

5. How and when did the attackers obtain domain administrator credentials?

6. What did the attackers look for on each system?

7. Damage Assessment: what data was stolen?

8. Damage Assessment: was email accessed or stolen?

9. Was any evidence of anti-forensics activity discovered?

10. Were the attackers able to access any cloud-based resources like cloud computing resources or cloud storage data?

11. Threat Intelligence: catalog host-based and network indicators of compromise.

REMEDIATION AND RECOVERY:

12. What level of account compromise occurred? Is a full password reset required during remediation?

13. Based on the attacker techniques and tools discovered during the incident, what are the recommended steps to remediate and recover from this incident?

a. What systems need to be rebuilt?

b. What IP addresses need to be blocked?

c. What countermeasures should we deploy to slow or stop these attackers if they come back?

d. What recommendations would you make to detect these intruders in our network again?
